# 1BillionRowChallenge

This is my solutions to the 1 Billion Row Challenge in different languages.

To test the solutions, run `python createMeasurements.py` which will create `measurements.txt`, a file with 1 Billion rows.

Then run the command for the relevant language with a timing command:

**Windows**: `Measure-Command {<command> | Out-Default}`

**Linux**: `time <command>`

## Python

**Command**: `python calculateAverage.py`
**Execution Time**: 126.9s
